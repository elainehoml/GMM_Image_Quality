    "The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of a 3D stack of greyscale images can be determined from the histogram of the grey values in the stack. Each material in the image (e.g. air, wax, tissue) is represented by a Gaussian distribution of grey values with a mean $\\mu$, standard deviation $\\sigma$ and weight <i><b>w</i></b>. SNR and CNR then calculated by the following equations:\n",

    "A phantom was created to validate this SNR and CNR measure. An example 3D micro-CT image stack kindly provided by Harry Rossides was segmented to produce three masks, each corresponding to air, wax and tissue respectively. Each pixel within each mask was assigned a random grey value from a normal distribution with a known $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. Several tests are then performed with this phantom with known Gaussian distributions of each material."
